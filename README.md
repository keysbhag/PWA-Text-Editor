# PWA Text Editor 


## Description 
The motivation for this project was to make a text editor for developers that would allow them to write code snippets or just writing notes in general, in an environment that would allow you to save your notes when you are connected to the internet, and when you do not have access to the internet. You also have the option to also download the application version on your browser and use the application without a browser.
